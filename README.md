#### Task of Lab 10:
<p> Create your very own frogger game! There a couple steps in doing this. First you should focus on creating the background and the two lanes. Once you have got that squared away your next task is to begin implementing "cars" and "logs" that bounce off each wall (use classes). Lastly, you should create your "frog" that starts at the bottom of the screen and can cross through the lanes with the direction keys on your keyboard. For bonus points, add a collision that detects when the car and frog "crash" 

#### How I did it?
  First I created a new sketch that was (500,500), and I chose the background color which was a light blue color. I next added two identical rectangles with about 130 pixels in between them. This created my "road".
  
  Next, I began creating classes which in my case were for a Car, a Flower, and a smiley face (frog). Within each class I added a move() and show () function. Each class looked something like this:
